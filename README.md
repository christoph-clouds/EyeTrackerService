# EyeTracker Service

Use eye-tracking data in web applications.

EyeTracker service is a bridge from eye tracking device connected to a computer and web-based applications running in the browser - for example a game or an interactive web-site.

## Requirements

* You must have a eye tracking device connected to your computer. I used Tobii EyeTracking connected to Windows 10.
* Built using .Net Framework 4.6.1

## How to run

1. Download the latest version from Github Releases

2. Unzip and run *EyeTracker.Service.Host.exe*

3. For a quick test, open */Client/index.html* in the browser and see the glaze positions displayed on screen.

   For more information, check [EyeTracker Client](/Client/README.md)
